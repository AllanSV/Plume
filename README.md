Plume Framework
===============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Coreoz/Plume.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Coreoz/Plume)

Plume Framework is a lightweight modular Java framework. It aims to remain as simple as possible while it can be customized 
enough to fit exactly your application need.
Plume is mainly aggregating (great) JVM libraries. This way, the Plume code base is limited to the minimum
so that the aggregated libraries can function together.  

Plume Framework require at least Java 8. Its modules contains connectors for
[Guice](https://github.com/google/guice) and [Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger).

Plume Framework is maintained by [Coreoz](http://coreoz.com/)

Getting started
---------------

The best way to get started it to use a
[Maven archetype for Plume Framework](https://github.com/Coreoz/Plume-archetypes).

Dependency injection
--------------------
TODO explain how Guice should be used

For Dagger, you are on your own, just know there is a DaggerModule for each GuiceModule.
Moreover, the Dagger documentation is available at <http://google.github.io/dagger/users-guide.html>.
Also to use Dagger the annotation processor should be enabled in your IDE: <https://immutables.github.io/apt.html>.
